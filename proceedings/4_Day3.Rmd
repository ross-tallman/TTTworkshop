# DAY 3

## WRITING **R** PACKAGES (ANDERSON)

The third day of the TTT workshop started with a presentation by Sean Anderson on R package development.
Sean used materials from presentations by Harley Wickam (senior scientist at RStudio) to get participants started with developing R packages.
The development of R packages is greatly simplified by using an RStudio's project and taking advantage of its many available tools related to package development.
For example, one can create a project in RStudio and define it as an R package, and the software will create the necessary backbone of an R package.
Sean covered the development of an R package, the generation of its documentation using ROxygen, unit testing of the package, and package testing.

Exercises were done by the participants to learn how to alter an example package.
It was demonstrated how to create a new file in an R package enviroment employing the `usethis::use_r("file-name")` function.
Tips were provided on how to edit the users R profile to load key packages.

Resources from Hadley Wickham were presented such as "Advanced R" (Wickham 2014)(https://adv-r.hadley.nz/), "R Packages" (Wickham 2015)(http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) and "R for Data Science" (Wickham 2016) (https://r4ds.had.co.nz/).
These resources are available on line as well as in print form.

## TRANSLATING CSAS DOCUMENTS (ANN MARISCAK)

A presentation was made regarding the new policies for outputing CSAS documents.
As a legal requirement, the Department must ensure that all CSAS documents are written into both official languages.
As well, it is required that the documents be accessible for persons with disabilities and be compatible with tools such as screen readers.
It was noted that translation of text will slow the final output of documents and increase their cost.
Tools such as LatTex and CSASDown may be able to assist in translation and thereby shorten the time and reduce the cost to produce fully translated documents.
Another problem will be translation of figures into the other offical language.
It was suggested that it might be possible for an automated translation of frequently used words such as "Age" or "Fork Length".

### Editing vs. Translation

There was a suggestion that documents can be translated to French using Google Docs and subsequentially sent for editing as opposed to translation.
If editing is less a less expensive service than translation, this could be an option worth considering in some situations.
Authors choosing to do this would have to ensure the integrity of the text was correctly maintained through the translation process.

### Translation Databases

Ann mentioned the existance of a Government of Canada database called [Termimum Plus](https://www.btb.termiumplus.gc.ca/tpv2alpha/alpha-eng.html?lang=eng).
Termimum Plus is an invaluable tool used for the translation of technical terminology.
The quality of the translation are perteptually being improved through expert-user feedback and contribution.
Daniel Ricard made mention of another translation database native to DFO called the [DFO Bilingual Lexicon](http://address-needed.com).

## BREAK-OUT GROUPS

Workshop participants separated out into five break-out groups.  Workshops participants were able to self-select which group they went to, which worked well.

The first of these groups worked on an applied example, in which they worked together to compose a trip report for a the Newfounland and Labradour Region using R markdown.

The second of these groups ... focussed on a brainstorming session about .. the development of tools to automate language translation of CSAS research documents ???

The remaining three groups worked on collaboratively writing text for this workshop proceedings document using GitHub, with each group tasked with summarizing one day of the workshop.
A proceedings template document that met the format requirements of the Canadian Techncial Report was compiled ahead of time.
The three report-writing groups were able to clone the relevant repository and make changes to the template.
